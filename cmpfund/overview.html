<p>The purpose of this tutorial is to introduce you to Computers and its fundamentals.

Functionalities of a Computer<br/>
    <img src="Overview/computerfunction.jpeg"/><br/>
If we look at it in a very broad sense, any digital computer carries out the following five functions −

Step 1 − Takes data as input.<br/>

Step 2 − Stores the data/instructions in its memory and uses them as required.<br/>

Step 3 − Processes the data and converts it into useful information.<br/>

Step 4 − Generates the output.<br/>

Step 5 − Controls all the above four steps.Advantages of Computers<br/>

    <h1>Advantages of computers.</h1>
<ul>
    <li>High Speed:-</li>
    <ol>
        <li>Computer is a very fast device.</li>
        <li>It is capable of performing calculation of very large amount of data.</li>
        <li>The computer has units of speed in microsecond, nanosecond, and even the picosecond.</li>
        <li>It can perform millions of calculations in a few seconds as compared to man who will spend many months to perform the same task.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Accuracy:-</li>
    <ol>
        <li>In addition to being very fast, computers are very accurate.</li>
        <li>The calculations are 100% error free.</li>
        <li>Computers perform all jobs with 100% accuracy provided that the input is correct.</li>
    </ol>
<li>Storage Capability:-</li>
    <ol>
        <li>Memory is a very important characteristic of computers.</li>
        <li>A computer has much more storage capacity than human beings.</li>
        <li>It can store large amount of data.</li>
        <li>It can store any type of data such as images, videos, text, audio, etc.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Diligence:-</li>
    <ol>
        <li>Unlike human beings, a computer is free from monotony, tiredness, and lack of concentration</li>.
        <li>It can work continuously without any error and boredom.</li>
        <li>It can perform repeated tasks with the same speed and accuracy.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Versatility:-</li>
    <ol>
        <li>A computer is a very versatile machine.</li>
        <li>A computer is very flexible in performing the jobs to be done.</li>
        <li>This machine can be used to solve the problems related to various fields.</li>
        <li>At one instance, it may be solving a complex scientific problem and the very next moment it may be playing a card game.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Reliability:-</li>
    <ol>
        <li>A computer is a reliable machine.</li>
        <li>Modern electronic components have long lives.</li>
        <li>Computers are designed to make maintenance easy.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Automation:-</li>
    <ol>
<li>Computer is an automatic machine.
        <li>Automation is the ability to perform a given task automatically</li>
            <li>Once the computer receives a program i.e., the program is stored in the computer memory, then the program and instruction can control the program execution without human interaction.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Reduction in Paper Work and Cost:-</li>
    <ol>
        <li>The use of computers for data processing in an organization leads to reduction in paper work and results in speeding up the process.</li>
        <li>As data in electronic files can be retrieved as and when required, the problem of maintenance of large number of paper files gets reduced.</li>
        <li>Though the initial investment for installing a computer is high, it substantially reduces the cost of each of its transaction.</li>
    </ol>
    <h1>Disadvantages of Computers</h1>
    <li>No I.Q.</li>
A computer is a machine that has no intelligence to perform any task.
Each instruction has to be given to the computer.
A computer cannot take any decision on its own.<br/>

    <li>Dependency:-</li>
It functions as per the user’s instruction, thus it is fully dependent on humans.<br/>
    
    <li>Environment:-</li>
The operating environment of the computer should be dust free and suitable.<br/>

    <li>No Feeling:-</li>
Computers have no feelings or emotions.
It cannot make judgment based on feeling, taste, experience, and knowledge unlike humans.<br/>
